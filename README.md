## Red's Assorted Cards

A while ago I got Inscryption and was fascinated by all of the different mods people had made for it, so I decided I wanted to make one myself. This is that mod. At first I tried to make the cards fit in with the base game as much as possible, but eventually decided it would be more fun to just do whatever I wanted with the cards, so a lot of them are random and silly and don't fit into the game really well, but they're still fun to play around with.

## Additions

Currently, this mod only adds two cards, and one of them is only obtainable while in a battle.
